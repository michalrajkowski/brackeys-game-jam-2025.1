Speedrun:
Block handler:


# ORE_SYSTEM -- DONE --
+ ore generate underground
+ player can collect them
+ can be sold on top
    + when player enterns certain area, his items are sold. 
    + he gets gold based of that

# DANGER-O-METER
- after during each %10 mining we trigger a hit
- hits add up to denger-o-METER
- danger-o-meter triggers negative effects
- danger-o-meter rises with game time

# 


(Unbreakable floor and mine entrance)

(line throwing ? )


Block minig mechanics:
- square blocks on the map?
- player can mine them?

Traits assigned to blocks? Better map generation? (with random resources + caves spawn?)
- ores
    - randomise ore based on depth
    - some "story locations" underground / special stuff
    - maybe do not tie mechanics only to sprite? xd
    - better map generator / blocks traits handler!

Changed map visibilty
- render dark space in places not explored by player
    - show blocks around player tunels?
    - extra: some "gradient" for block that is 1 further? (so it is partialy visible?)

- game timer / out of control mechanism 

++ block marker to see what player will mine?

+ Mining mechanic
    + look at block markers
    + if player is in proximity (very close) and is holding correct direction key, start mining. 
> Perform mining:
    - show mining gizmo/timer
    - if complete, destrony block
        - store destroyed blocks?
        - blocks as ID, get currently mined block traits!


- double click up to throw the rope. When it hits the celling, it creates a rope. On the rope one does not fall and can swing up/down as he wishes. 


Fog of war?

Resources + EQ system?

SOME NORMAL BLOCK DATA STORING!!!


BUGFIX:
- allow player to "fit" in tight spaces:
    - needs modifying of collision handling, mining blocks proximity
