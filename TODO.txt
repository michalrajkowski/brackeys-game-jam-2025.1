Block minig mechanics:
- square blocks on the map?
- player can mine them?

Traits assigned to blocks? Better map generation? (with random resources + caves spawn?)
- ores
    - randomise ore based on depth
    - some "story locations" underground / special stuff
    - maybe do not tie mechanics only to sprite? xd
    - better map generator / blocks traits handler!

Changed map visibilty
- render dark space in places not explored by player
    - show blocks around player tunels?
    - extra: some "gradient" for block that is 1 further? (so it is partialy visible?)

- game timer / out of control mechanism 

++ block marker to see what player will mine?

- Mining mechanic
    - look at block markers
    - if player is in proximity (very close) and is holding correct direction key, start mining. 

- double click up to throw the rope. When it hits the celling, it creates a rope. On the rope one does not fall and can swing up/down as he wishes.
