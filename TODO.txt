Block minig mechanics:
- square blocks on the map?
- player can mine them?

Changed map visibilty
- render dark space in places not explored by player
    - show blocks around player tunels?
    - extra: some "gradient" for block that is 1 further? (so it is partialy visible?)

- game timer / out of control mechanism
